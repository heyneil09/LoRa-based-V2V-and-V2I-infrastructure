This project demonstrates a robust LoRa-based Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication system for real-time monitoring and dynamic resource management in electric vehicles (EVs). It leverages the long-range, low-power capabilities of LoRa technology to establish a reliable communication network for exchanging data between vehicles and infrastructure nodes.

Key features include:

V2V Communication: Vehicles can exchange critical information such as battery status and charging requirements. The receiver node can accept or decline charging requests dynamically.

V2I Communication: Vehicles communicate with an infrastructure node (Dragino Pico Station) for remote monitoring and data logging through The Things Network (TTN) cloud platform.

Python-Based GUI: A user-friendly interface enables real-time monitoring, charging request management, and system status updates. Users can also input charging capacity requests and track progress.

Dynamic Resource Allocation: Once a request is accepted, the system estimates the charging time and establishes a secure communication link to facilitate efficient power transfer.

This project is scalable, power-efficient, and designed for real-world applications in EV networks, paving the way for seamless integration of IoT technologies in transportation systems.
